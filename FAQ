* IDX-tsunami crash when I start it 

  does your erlang system has ssl support enabled ?

  to test it:
  > erl
  Eshell V5.2  (abort with ^G)
  1> ssl:start()
  you should see 'ok' 

 if it doesn't work, maybe you can do the following thing (it seems to
 be a bug in the R9B-0 building process) :

 cd /usr/lib/erlang/lib/ssl-2.3.5/priv
 mkdir bin
 cd obj
 make

* SSL works fine, but IDX-tsunami still crash when I start it 

do you have a ~/.erlang.hosts file ?
to test if it works, do the following thing:

  > erl -name test
  Eshell V5.2  (abort with ^G)
  1> net_adm:world()

If you see '** exited: {error,enoent} **', then something is wrong in
your ~/.erlang.hosts file or in /etc/hosts


* IDX-tsunami still crash !

 to see what happen, start IDX-Tsunami by hand (replace $prefix by the
 directory where IDX-Tsunami is installed, /usr/local/idx-tsunami by
 default)

 1. create a config file with 'idx-tsunami.pl --config'

 2. cd to the ebin directory ($prefix/erlang/tsunami-0.2.0/ebin)

 3. start the tsunami application in a first node:
 erl -name tsunami0 -setcookie 'tsunami'   -config $prefix/etc/tsunami0.config
 Eshell V5.2  (abort with ^G)
 1> ssl:start().
 ok
 2> application:start(tsunami).
 you should see 'ok' 

 4. in another shell, in the same directory, start the
 tsunami_controller application in a second node:
 erl -name controller -setcookie 'tsunami'   -config $prefix/etc/tsunami0.config
 Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.2 [source] [hipe] [threads:0]
 Eshell V5.2  (abort with ^G)
 1> ssl:start().
 ok
 2> application:start(tsunami_controller).
 you should see 'ok' 

 If something is wrong, start sasl (application:start(sasl) first to
 have more logs about what happens
