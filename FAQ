* IDX-tsunami crash when I start it 

  does your erlang system has ssl support enabled ?

  to test it:
  > erl
  Eshell V5.2  (abort with ^G)
  1> ssl:start()
  you should see 'ok' 

 if it doesn't work, maybe you can do the following thing (it seems to
 be a bug in the R9B-0 building process) :

 cd /usr/lib/erlang/lib/ssl-2.3.5/priv
 mkdir bin
 cd obj
 make

* IDX-tsunami still crash  when I start it

 First look at the log file
 'idx-tsunami.log-tsunami_controller@yourhostname' to see if there is
 a problem. 

 1/ if not, you can compile idx-tsunami with full debugging: set
 OPTIONS to +debug_info -DDEBUG in the Makefile, and don't forget to
 set the loglevel to "debug" in the XML file

 To start the debugguer or see what happen, start IDX-Tsunami with the
 'debug' argument instead of start. You will have an erlang shell on
 the tsunami_controller node. Use toolbar:start() to launch the
 graphical tools provided by Erlang.

* What is the format of the stats file idx-tsunami.log0 ?

 this file is updated every 10s, it looks like:

 ----
 # stats: dump at 1045817668
 stats: reconnect 1 11
 stats: page_resptime 2 23.9185 1.83948 202.245 22.0790 2 
 stats: size 58269 664029

 stats: 200 2 16
 stats: 404 3 49
 # stats: dump at 1045817678

 stats: page_resptime 1 56.2450 0.00000e+0 202.245 22.0790 1

 stats: response_time 1 56.2450 0.00000e+0 56.2450 1.84204 1 
 stats: 200 1 17
 stats: 404 0 49
 ...
 ----

 the format is, for page_resptime, response_time, session:
 # stats:'name' count(during the last 10sec), mean, stdvar, max, min, count(again, useless)
 or for HTTP returns code, size, reconnect ...
 # stats:'name' count(during the last 10sec), totalcount(since the beginning)

* How can i specify the number of concurrent users ?
  
  You can't. But it's on purpose: the load generated by IDX-Tsunami
  is dependent on the arrival time between new clients. Indeed, once a
  client has finished his session in idx-tsunami, it stops. So the
  number of concurrent users is a function of the arrival rate and the
  mean session duration.

  For example, if your web site has 1000 visits/hour, the arrival rate
  is 1000/3600 = 0.2778 visit/seconds. If you want to simulate the
  same load, set the inter-arrival time is to 1/0.27778 = 3.6 sec
  (<users interarrival="3.6" unit="second"> in the 'arrivalphase'
  node in the XML config file)

  To double the load, divide the inter-arrival by 2.

* SNMP monitoring doesn't work ?!

 There is a bug in R9C in the snmp_mgr module. You have to apply this
 patch to make it work:
