.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtsung\fR is a distributed load testing
tool. It is protocol-independent and can currently be used to
stress and benchmark HTTP, WebDAV, LDAP, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Jabber/XMPP servers.
.PP
It simulates user behaviour using an XML description file,
reports many measurements in real time (statistics can be
customized with transactions, and graphics generated using
gnuplot). 
.PP
For HTTP, it supports 1.0 and 1.1, has a proxy mode to
record sessions, supports GET and POST methods, Cookies, and Basic
WWW-authentication. It also has support for SSL.
