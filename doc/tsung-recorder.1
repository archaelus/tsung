\fBtsung\fR is a distributed load testing

stress and benchmark HTTP, WebDAV, LDAP, PostgreSQL, MySQL and

used to record sessions (only for HTTP, WebDAV and Postgresql) that can be edited and replayed later by tsung

tsung native XML format; it can be used by your favorite client (browser in the case of the http plugin).
