# Comment lines start with a ``#'' as the first
# character.  Lines with only whitespace delimit
# sessions (multiple blank lines do not generate
# ``null'' sessions).  All other lines specify a
# uri-sequence (1 uri per line).  If the first
# character of the line is whitespace (e.g. space
# or tab), the uri is considered to be part of a
# burst that is sent out after the previous
# non-burst uri.

# currently, IDX-Tsunami only parses the URL, arguments are not yet
# used (the thinktime is set globally in idx-tsunamirc)
