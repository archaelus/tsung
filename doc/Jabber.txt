Requirements:
============

users has to be already registered:

IDX-TSUNAMI users name  :  cXX
                  passwd:  pasXX

where XX is a integer between 1 and the maximum number of users (say 1000000).

or you can use jabber_register (see below).

optional parameters: (can be set in idx-tsunamirc file)
==================

JABBER_DOMAIN=mydomain.com
N_ROSTER_CLIENTS=6 (see below)

modules implemented for the Jabber protocol:
============================================

- jabber_common: module regrouping common functions for building
  messages

- jabber_online: simulate users sending 'chat' messages to online clients only.

- jabber_unique: simulate users sending 'chat' messages to a single user.

- jabber_offline: simulate users sending 'chat' messages to offline clients		
  only.

- jabber_auth: simulate users that connects to ther server and then
  leave without sending messages.

- jabber_roster: simulate users sending presence, roster:set and
  roster:get messages. 
  Each client send N_ROSTER_CLIENTS type='subscribed' messages, and
  after upload their roster MESSAGES_NUMBER times.
  the variable N_ROSTER_CLIENTS (6 by default) can be changed in the
  config file.

- jabber_register: each simultated user send a jabber:iq:register,
  type=set message to the server.

- jabber_dynamic: simulate users sending "dynamic" chat messages
  (messages are build on the fly by the process, and not at the startup
  time like other messages. This allow you to use a really big value for
  MESSAGES_NUMBER without taking too much memory).

NOTE: currently, no XML parsing is done by the receiving process.
