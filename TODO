- groupchat for Jabber

- Maybe use a single gen_server instead of 4 (msg, user, request, timer)

- instead of logging everything, let the client (or the monitor)
  compute stats ?

- Maybe use a single monitor process for all beams ? this allow us to
centralise the results, (but it can be a bottleneck if too much
logging data are sent to it ?)

- implement client parsing server response (needed for some protocols)

- clients may do a checksum to control integrity of responses ?

- implement http protocol:
	- reuse already existing erlang modules.
	- handle non persistant connections (http/1.0) within a user session
    - how to handle http/1.1 pipelining ?

- other useful protocols: ftp, ldap, sql ... ?
