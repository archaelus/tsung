<hr>

<p>
	  The purpose of IDX-Tsunami is to simulate users in order to test the
  scalability and performances of IP based client/server
  applications. Currently, only the Jabber protocol has been
  implemented and tested, but it can be easily extended . IDX-Tsunami
  use the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> language.
</p>
<p>

  This tool can simulate thousands of users concurrently, and can be
  distributed on several client machines. Up to 10000 users can be
  simulated on a single machine (the limit depends on the hardware and
  also on the activity of the simulated clients).
</p>
<p>
  The idea is to simulate the behavior of a real world client using a
  stochastic model, in order to achieve a more realistic traffic than
  other simple models (deterministics).
</p>
<p>

  A client's session is characterize by:

<ul>
   <li>   the number of requests during a session
   <li>   the mean time elapsed between each request ("think time")
   <li>   the type and parameters of requests (including, for example,
        'chat' message size for Jabber)
</ul>

and each of these parameters can be fixed, or random (by default,
<em>think time</em> use an exponential distribution).
</p>
<p>
	  The arrival process of users into the server is also characterize by a
random distribution (exponential by default).
