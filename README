1.1.  General

  This document gives pointers for information on this package which is
  distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2 (see file
  COPYING).

  1.2.  What This Package Is

  The purpose of IDX-TSUNAMI is to simulate users in order to test
  the scalability and performances of IP based client/server
  applications. Currently, HTTP and Jabber protocol have been
  implemented and tested, but it can be easily extended (see
  doc/Design.txt). IDX-TSUNAMI use the Erlang language.

  This tool can simulate thousands of users concurrently, and can be
  distributed on several client machines. Up to 10000 users can be
  simulated on a single machine (the limit depends on the hardware and
  also on the activity of the simulated clients).
